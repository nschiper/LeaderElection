# LeaderElection

This repository contains a leader election service developped during my MSc thesis at the University of Toronto under the supervision of Prof. Sam Toueg. The service is based on adapted versions of two existing leader election algorithms: one is more robust in the face of flaky links, while the other is more scalable, in steady-state only the leader broadcasts heartbeats.

A paper describing this service and its evaluation can be found [here](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4630089).
